    <h3>Pre-release notes from your's truly</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The game is not finished</li>
        <li>Think about this as Early Access</li>
        <li>I would probably call this the 0.8 version</li>
        <li>This took a fair bit longer than what I thought</li>
        <li>Boy did it take me a long time to get those Community Chests looking good</li>
        <li>At the moment, you can move pieces arround the board and examine the diferent properties</li>
        <li>Also if you land in jail there's no way to get out as I havent implemented getting out of jail yet</li>
        <li>This version is structured to house the full game, so theres a lot more behind the scenes that you dont see</li>
        <li>One of my inital ideas was to have the home screen be a settings page where you input player's info, etc.</li>
        <li>As of now that data is all hard coded into the data.js file</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Fun fact: every single graphical value in the program is relative to a single scale factor<br>As a result, reloading the page on super small or super large resolutions still looks good</p>
